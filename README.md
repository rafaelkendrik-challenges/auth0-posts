===========

  An [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) channel developed in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) that receives `Web-hooks` from written posts for [Auth0's Blog](https://auth0.com/blog) shared on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and push them to a history collection into a [MLab](https://mlab.com/) database.

  My simple implementation of [If This Then Node.js - Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/if-this-then-node-dot-js-extending-ifttt-with-webtask-dot-io/).
